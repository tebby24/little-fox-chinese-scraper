# Little Fox Chinese Scraper
'utils.py' contains a few python classes that can be used to scrape all the content from the site. That being said, you shouldn't need to scrape anything else because all relevant urls have been written to 'data/urls.json'.

I have provided the output of 'download_and_convert_subtitles.py' in '/subtitles'

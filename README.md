# Little Fox Chinese Scraper
A Python program that scrapes the subtitles from chinese.littlefox.com and converts the subtites to SRT format.

The XML subtitles for the stories from levels 1 and 2 are formatted differently than the rest of the content. After trying and failing to normalize them to proper SRT for a couple of hours I decided to give up... So, the collection that I scraped only contains subtitles for levels 3 and on.
